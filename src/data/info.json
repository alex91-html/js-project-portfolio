    "title": "About",
    "content": "Alexander Übelhör, Graphic Designer with coding skills and background in motion graphics, 3D animation.\n\nWith a BA in Graphic Design and freelance experience, I’ve worked across formats—from posters and digital layouts to animated visuals and short-form video content. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set through the Technigo Web Development bootcamp, deepening my knowledge of front-end and full-stack development.\n\nCurious by nature, I enjoy exploring new tools and creative methods that strengthen my core practice in design and development. Whether working solo or as part of a team, I try to bring adaptability, intention, and a genuine passion for visual arts and technology to every project.\n\nI'm interested in contemporary culture, art, and new media, and I also enjoy creatively exploring the intersections between them. In addition to applied work I continue a practice of personal and collaborative visual art and moving image work."
