    "title": "About",
    "content": "Currently, I'm expanding my skill set through the Technigo Web Development bootcamp, deepening my knowledge of front-end and full-stack development.\n\nMy journey began with Graphic Design, where I earned my BA at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. Subsequently, I started freelancing working across diverse formats: print design, digital layouts to motion graphics and short-form video while also working as an artist assistant.\n\nTools & technology has always been an area of interest and curiosity that I find strongly connected with the craft of design. The transition to web development feels natural—coding is another form of creative problem solving, and my design background can help me understand how users interact with interfaces. I'm looking forward to applying my newly acquired skills to the building of designs.\n\nRecently moved to Stockholm, I'm open to opportunities that let me combine my visual background with my growing development skills, whether as part of a collaborative team or on challenging solo projects. In addition to applied work, I continue a practice of personal and collaborative visual art and moving image work."
