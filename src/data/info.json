    "content": "Currently freelancing as web developer and graphic designer based in Stockholm. I’ve worked across formats—from posters and digital layouts to animated visuals and short-form video content.\n\nCurious by nature, I enjoy exploring new tools and creative methods that strengthen my core practice in design and development. Whether working solo or as part of a team, I try to bring adaptability, intention, and a genuine passion for visual arts and technology to every project.\n\nIn addition to applied work I continue a practice of personal and collaborative visual art and moving image work."
